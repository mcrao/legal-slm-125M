# legal-slm-125 — a 125M legal & financial language model, from scratch

Build a 125-million-parameter Llama-style language model **from a random
initialization** — data pipeline, tokenizer, pretraining, evaluation, a live web
demo, and finally **supervised fine-tuning into a Q&A assistant** — for legal and
financial English. Everything is streamed, cleaned, and trained reproducibly on
[Modal](https://modal.com); the finished models live on Hugging Face and one is
served through a Vercel front end.

The full arc: **random weights → a base model that writes fluent legal/financial
text → a fine-tuned model that answers questions about it.**

## How it works

The whole build is driven by a single config file (`config.py`) and runs as a
sequence of **phases**, each a Modal function fanned out one worker per shard:

```
Phase 0  smoke + measure   →  confirm the data streams and how many tokens exist
Phase 1  clean             →  stream + deterministic cleaning        → /data/clean
Phase 2  dedup + decontam  →  MinHash-LSH + exact + 13-gram strip    → /data/corpus
Phase 3  tokenizer         →  train a 16,384 byte-level BPE          → /data/tokenizer
Phase 4  tokenize + pack   →  uint16 1024-token windows, 99/1 split  → /data/tokens
Phase 5  pretrain          →  8×H100 DDP, 2 epochs                   → /data/checkpoints
Phase 6  evaluate + push   →  full-val perplexity + upload to HF
Phase 7  serve             →  Modal inference endpoint + Vercel site
Phase 8  fine-tune (SFT)   →  Gemini Q&A dataset → 1×L4 fine-tune     → /data/sft
Phase 9  RAFT              →  OpenRouter context dataset → 1×L4 tune  → /data/raft
```

All durable artifacts live on one Modal Volume (`slm-125m`) mounted at `/data`,
so any phase can be re-run or resumed independently.

## Repository layout

| File / dir | Role |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | **Single source of truth** — model, data mix, token budgets, cleaning thresholds, training hyperparameters, paths |
| `cleaning.py` | Deterministic, rule-based document cleaning (pure functions) |
| `dedup.py` | Hash / shingle / n-gram helpers for dedup + decontamination |
| `modal_app.py` | Modal app: images, Volume, and one function per phase (0–4, plus pretrain & evaluate) |
| `train.py` | Standalone DDP training loop, launched under `torchrun` on 8×H100 |
| `inference.py` | Modal scale-to-zero CPU endpoint that streams base-model completions (Phase 7) |
| `inference_chat.py` | Modal scale-to-zero CPU endpoint that streams the fine-tuned model's chat replies |
| `web/` | Next.js 16 front end on Vercel — the live playground **and chat** |
| `finetune.py` | Phase 8 dataset pipeline: Gemini Q&A synthesis, LLM-judge, dedup, tokenize |
| `train_sft.py` | Phase 8 supervised fine-tuning loop (single GPU, full FT, loss-masked) |
| `raft.py` | Phase 9 RAFT dataset pipeline: OpenRouter teacher, judge, oracle+distractor assembly |
| `train_raft.py` | Phase 9 RAFT fine-tuning loop (continues from the SFT model) |
| `inference_raft.py` | Modal endpoint that answers from user-provided context (RAFT backend) |
| `raft_eval.py` | Evaluates the base → SFT → RAFT arc (perplexity + answer-match accuracy) |

## Prerequisites

1. **Modal** — `pip install modal && modal token new` (free tier includes monthly
   compute credits). The GPU phase needs H100 access on your Modal plan.
2. **Hugging Face** — a token with the **write** role
   (huggingface.co/settings/tokens); needed to push the models in Phases 6 and 8.
   For fine-tuning (Phase 8) you also need a **Google Gemini API key**
   (aistudio.google.com), stored as a Modal secret:
   `modal secret create gemini-api GEMINI_API_KEY=...`.
3. Copy the env template and fill in your own values (never commit it):
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # edit .env.local, then, before commands that need the tokens:
   source .env.local && export MODAL_TOKEN_ID MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET
   ```
4. **Node 18+** and the **Vercel CLI** (`npm i -g vercel`) for the web demo.

Sanity-check the config locally (no Modal needed):
```bash
python3 config.py
# slm-125m
# model: 125,847,552 params (~125.8M) | vocab 16384 | 12L/768d/12h kv=12
```

## The data

Three public, ungated datasets, streamed from Hugging Face (never fully
downloaded):

| Source | HF id | split | field |
|---|---|---|---|
| US case law | `HFforLegal/case-law` | `us` | `document` |
| SEC filings | `PleIAs/SEC` | `train` | `text` |
| Educational web | `HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu` (`sample-10BT`) | `train` | `text` |

**The mix is not 70/20/10.** The obvious plan — 70% case law, 20% SEC, 10% web at
~10B tokens — is impossible, because the legal sources are small. Measured clean
yields (run Phase 0's `measure` to confirm): case law ~0.8B tokens, SEC ~1.2B,
fineweb effectively unlimited. So the two legal sources cap at ~2B tokens total.

The strategy is **"legal-first"**: take *all* of case law (budget 1.0B) and *all*
of SEC (budget 1.3B), then add a small web slice (0.5B) for fluency. Budgets live
in `config.DATA_MIX`. The **realized** mix after real tokenization was:

| Source | Tokens | Share |
|---|---|---|
| US case law | 715M | 35% |
| SEC filings | 860M | 42% |
| Educational web | 464M | 23% |
| **Total (train)** | **2.04B** | 100% |

You get more "tokens seen" by running multiple **epochs** over this fixed corpus,
not by collecting more unique tokens.

## Replicate it, phase by phase

Run one phase, check the output, then continue. Do not chain them silently.

### Phase 0 — smoke + measure (CPU, ~$0)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::main       # stream 10 docs/source, clean, print
modal run modal_app.py::measure    # project true clean-token yield per source
```
Expect ~9–10 of 10 docs kept per source, and `measure` to report roughly case-law
~0.8B, SEC ~1.2B, fineweb ~11B — the evidence for legal-first.

### Phase 1 — clean (CPU, a few minutes)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::clean --fineweb-shards 5
```
Fans out ~20 workers (one per parquet shard), applies the deterministic chain
(line filter → boilerplate strip → length/repetition/language gates → an OCR gate
for scanned case law), and writes `/data/clean/<source>/shard-XX.txt`. Expect
~718k docs streamed, ~698k kept (~97%).

### Phase 2 — dedup + decontaminate (CPU, ~6 min)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::dedup
```
MinHash signatures per case-law shard → one LSH near-duplicate pass → a per-shard
writer that also drops exact duplicates and **13-gram matches against the CaseHOLD
/ LexGLUE benchmarks** (so evaluation stays honest). Writes `/data/corpus/…`.
Expect ~24k CaseHOLD-contaminated docs removed, ~1.6k near-dups, ~2k SEC exact
dups; ~670k docs remain.

### Phase 3 — train the tokenizer (CPU, ~4 min)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::tokenizer
```
Trains a fresh **16,384** byte-level BPE on the whole corpus and saves it to
`/data/tokenizer/`. Expect `vocab_size=16384` and two `roundtrip=True` checks.

### Phase 4 — tokenize + pack (CPU, ~10 min)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::tokenize
```
14 workers encode the corpus, append `<|eos|>` after each document, pack into
**1024-token uint16 windows**, and route every 100th window to validation (a clean
99/1 split). Writes `/data/tokens/{train,val}/*.bin` and `index.json`. Expect
**train ≈ 2.04B tokens (1,991,282 windows), val ≈ 20.6M tokens (20,119 windows)**.

### Phase 5 — pretrain on 8×H100 (GPU)
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::pretrain_smoke      # 30-step sanity check
modal run modal_app.py::pretrain_run        # full 2-epoch run (compile ON)
```
`train.py` runs under `torchrun` with 8-way DDP, bfloat16, SDPA/flash attention,
and `torch.compile`. Hyperparameters come straight from `config.TRAIN`:

| | |
|---|---|
| Global batch | 524,288 tokens (512 windows/step) |
| Steps | 7,778 (2 epochs × 3,889) |
| Optimizer | AdamW β=(0.9, 0.95), wd 0.1 (2D params only), grad-clip 1.0 |
| LR schedule | 6e-4 → 6e-5 cosine, 200M-token linear warmup |
| Checkpoints | every 500 steps (resumable), metrics every 20, eval every 1000 |

Checkpoints (`/data/checkpoints/ckpt.pt`) make the run **resumable** — if it dies,
`pretrain_run` picks up from the last checkpoint. Throughput was ~3.19M tok/s at
~30% MFU; the useful compute is ~15–20 minutes.

### Phase 6 — evaluate + push to Hugging Face
```bash
modal run modal_app.py::evaluate           # full-val perplexity + sample generations (1×L4)
```
Then download the finished model + tokenizer from the Volume and upload them to
your HF repo (set `HF_REPO` in `config.py` first):
```bash
modal volume get slm-125m /checkpoints/base ./hf_export
modal volume get slm-125m /tokenizer        ./hf_export
huggingface-cli upload jonam-ai/slm-125m-base ./hf_export .
```
Expect a held-out perplexity around **9.13**.

### Phase 7 — serve the live demo
```bash
modal deploy inference.py                   # scale-to-zero CPU endpoint, streams tokens (SSE)
cd web
npm install
# set NEXT_PUBLIC_INFERENCE_URL to your Modal endpoint (or edit app/lib/model.ts)
npm run dev                                 # local preview
vercel deploy --prod                        # ship to Vercel
```
`inference.py` loads the HF model once per container and serves `/generate` with
token-by-token streaming; it scales to zero when idle (≈ $0). The Next.js site
calls it and renders the completion live.

### Phase 8 — fine-tune into a Q&A assistant (Gemini + 1×L4)
```bash
modal run finetune.py::pilot          # 20-passage sanity + live cost projection
modal run finetune.py::build          # generate + LLM-judge the full Q&A set
modal run finetune.py::curate_run     # dedup + format + tokenize (mentor tokenizer)
modal run train_sft.py::run --epochs 2  # supervised fine-tune on 1×L4
```
This turns the base model into one that *answers* questions. It is a full stage in
its own right — see **[Fine-tuning: from base model to Q&A assistant](#fine-tuning-from-base-model-to-qa-assistant)**
below for the pipeline, dataset, and design decisions.

## Model architecture

Maps 1:1 to `transformers.LlamaConfig`:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Layers / hidden / heads | 12 / 768 / 12 (head dim 64, MHA) |
| Intermediate (SwiGLU) | 3,072 |
| Context length | 1,024 |
| Positional encoding | RoPE (θ = 10,000) |
| Normalization | RMSNorm (ε = 1e-5) |
| Activation | SwiGLU (silu) |
| Vocab | 16,384 byte-level BPE |
| Embeddings | tied input/output |
| Precision | bfloat16 (weights saved fp32) |

## Design decisions (and why)

None of these choices are arbitrary. The guiding principle for a **125M model on a
tight budget** is: *spend every parameter and every FLOP where it buys the most
quality, and copy the modern, battle-tested defaults (the Llama recipe) instead of
re-inventing them.* Here is the reasoning behind each one.

### Why RoPE for positional encoding (θ = 10,000)
Rotary Positional Embeddings encode position by **rotating** the query and key
vectors by an angle proportional to their position, so the *relative* distance
between two tokens falls directly out of their attention dot-product. We chose it
over learned absolute position embeddings because:
- **Zero extra parameters.** Learned absolute embeddings would add
  `max_position × hidden` weights; RoPE adds none — precious for a small model.
- **Relative positions generalize better** than absolute indices, which matters for
  long, repetitive legal/financial documents.
- **Graceful length extension.** RoPE can be interpolated to longer contexts later
  (NTK / linear scaling) without retraining from scratch.
- It is the proven standard in Llama / Mistral / Qwen. `θ = 10,000` is the classic
  base frequency and is well-matched to a 1,024 context (the very large `θ` values
  are only needed for 32k+ long-context models).

### Why SwiGLU for the MLP activation
SwiGLU computes `SiLU(x·W_gate) ⊙ (x·W_up)` before projecting back down — a
**gated** MLP whose multiplicative interaction lets the network modulate its own
signal. Shazeer's *"GLU Variants Improve Transformer"* showed it gives a
consistently lower loss than plain ReLU/GELU MLPs at the same budget. It costs a
third weight matrix (hence `intermediate = 3,072`, three matrices instead of two),
but the quality-per-parameter gain is worth it and it is the Llama-family default.

### Why a 16,384-token vocabulary
- **Parameter economics.** The embedding table (tied to the LM head) is
  `vocab × hidden = 16,384 × 768 ≈ 12.6M` params — already ~10% of the whole model.
  A 32k–128k vocab would let the embeddings *dominate* a 125M budget, starving the
  actual transformer layers. A lean 16k keeps parameters in the layers where the
  reasoning happens.
- **A power of two (2¹⁴)** aligns cleanly with GPU matmul tiling.
- **Byte-level BPE means zero out-of-vocabulary** — every byte is representable, so
  the odd characters, `§` symbols, citations, and numbers in legal/financial text
  never break.
- **Trained on our own corpus**, so frequent domain terms (`plaintiff`,
  `pursuant`, `10-K`) become single tokens → fewer tokens per document → cheaper
  training and more effective context.
- Trade-off: a smaller vocab means slightly *more* tokens per document, but for a
  small model the cheaper embeddings and better parameter allocation win.

### Why a 1,024-token context length
- **Attention is O(sequence²).** 1,024 keeps compute and memory modest — decisive
  when you are GPU-cost-constrained.
- For *pretraining a base model*, 1,024-token windows are more than enough to learn
  syntax, local coherence, and domain style; longer context gives diminishing
  returns at 125M while multiplying cost.
- We **pack** documents into contiguous 1,024-token windows (separated by `<|eos|>`),
  so no compute is wasted on padding.
- It can be **extended later** via RoPE interpolation if a long-context variant is
  ever needed — the choice is not permanent.

### Why 12 layers / 768 dim / 12 heads (head dim 64)
- This is the **canonical "base" transformer shape** (GPT-2 / BERT-base). It reliably
  lands at ~125.8M params with tied embeddings and is one of the most studied,
  stable-to-train configurations that exists — so results are comparable to the
  literature and we avoid hand-tuning the aspect ratio.
- **Depth vs. width:** 12 layers × 768 dims is a proven balance. Going deeper-and-
  thinner can help reasoning but is harder to train stably at small scale; going
  wider-and-shallower under-uses depth. 12/768 is the sweet spot.
- **768 ÷ 12 = 64**, the standard head dimension that flash-attention kernels are
  optimized for — expressive enough per head, cheap enough to compute.
- We did not invent these numbers; we adopted the known-good ratio so the parameter
  budget goes into a shape that is guaranteed to train well.

### Why full Multi-Head Attention (not GQA / MQA)
We set `num_key_value_heads == num_attention_heads` (= 12), i.e. **every head keeps
its own K and V**. Grouped-Query (GQA) and Multi-Query (MQA) attention *share* K/V
across heads to shrink the KV-cache and speed up autoregressive decoding — but that
is an **inference-memory optimization that trades away a little quality**. At 125M
params with a 1,024 context the KV-cache is tiny and inference is already cheap, so
there is nothing to buy: full MHA gives maximum representational capacity per head.
GQA/MQA earn their keep at 7B+ scale and long context; here it would be premature
optimization.

### Why bfloat16 compute but fp32 saved weights
- **bfloat16** keeps fp32's full 8-bit exponent (same dynamic range) with fewer
  mantissa bits, so — unlike fp16 — it needs **no loss-scaling** and won't
  overflow/underflow during training, while halving memory bandwidth and doubling
  throughput on H100 tensor cores. It is the modern default for LLM pretraining.
- We **compute** in bf16 (autocast) but keep the master weights and optimizer state
  in **fp32**, so the tiny gradient updates accumulate with full numerical precision.
- We **save** the final weights in **fp32** (a lossless ~480MB `safetensors`) so the
  published artifact is the highest-fidelity copy. Anyone downstream can downcast to
  bf16/fp16 or quantize to int8/int4 as they wish — you can always *lose* precision
  later, but you can never recover it if you ship a lossy checkpoint.

### Two more Llama-recipe choices
- **RMSNorm** (instead of LayerNorm) drops the mean-subtraction and bias term for a
  cheaper, equally effective normalization — fewer ops, one less thing to learn.
- **Tied embeddings** share the input embedding matrix with the output LM head,
  saving ~12.6M parameters (that ~10% of the model) with no measurable quality loss
  at this scale — parameters better spent inside the layers.

## Results

Held-out perplexity over training (20.6M-token validation set):

| Step | 1000 | 2000 | 3000 | 4000 | 5000 | 6000 | 7000 | final |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Perplexity | 16.4 | 12.5 | 11.2 | 10.5 | 10.0 | 9.6 | 9.4 | **9.13** |

Sample completions are coherent, on-domain legal/financial prose (see the live
demo) — while, being a base model, inventing all specifics.

## Fine-tuning: from base model to Q&A assistant

The base model *continues* text; it cannot *answer* a question. Phase 8 turns it
into a small instruction-following assistant via **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**
on a synthetic legal/financial Q&A dataset.

- 🤗 **Instruct model:** https://huggingface.co/jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-sft
- 💬 **Live chat:** the "Chat" section of https://legal-slm-125.vercel.app — with a
  **Server / In-browser** toggle:
  - **Server** streams the fine-tuned model via `inference_chat.py` (scale-to-zero Modal).
  - **⚡ In-browser** runs the model **entirely on the visitor's device** via
    [transformers.js](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js) — an int8 ONNX
    export ([`jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-sft-onnx`](https://huggingface.co/jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-sft-onnx),
    ~140MB, cached after first load; the int8 step costs ~38% on held-out perplexity
    versus fp32, a deliberate size-for-quality trade). **No backend, $0 forever.** This is the only way
    to serve a custom model with zero server cost — HF's free serverless API doesn't
    host arbitrary models, and HF Docker Spaces now require a paid PRO plan.

### Why fine-tune on a *different* base model
We fine-tune on top of **`thesreedath/slm-125m-base`** — a peer's 125M model
pretrained for **10 epochs** on the same data — rather than our own 2-epoch base.
A better-trained base is a better starting point, and it is architecturally
identical (Llama, 12L/768d, vocab 16,384), so nothing downstream changes.

**The tokenizer subtlety that matters most:** a model's embedding rows are bound to
the exact token IDs of the tokenizer it trained with. That base has its *own*
16,384-token BPE — same size and same special tokens as ours, but a
separately-trained BPE maps text to **different IDs**. So the fine-tuning data
**must be tokenized with that model's `tokenizer.json`**, not ours. We load and
reuse it; we do **not** train a new tokenizer.

### Building the Q&A dataset (teacher-LLM distillation)
File: `finetune.py`. We synthesize grounded Q&A from the cleaned corpus with a
**teacher LLM** (Google Gemini), then filter hard with a second model as an
**LLM-as-judge**:

```
chunk_corpus   split the corpus into ~800-token grounded passages
generate       Gemini Flash-Lite writes SELF-CONTAINED Q&A answerable ONLY from the
               passage — balanced across task types (qa / extraction / summarization
               / rewrite) and difficulty (easy → hard)
judge          Gemini Flash scores each pair: grounded AND correct AND
               self-contained?  keep only score ≥ 4/5     (~78% pass)
curate         exact + MinHash-LSH near-dup removal; train/val split (disjoint ⇒
               decontaminated by construction); chat-JSONL; tokenize with the
               MENTOR tokenizer, loss-masked on the answer only
```

The teacher is told to **answer only from the passage** — if a question can't be
answered from it, don't invent one — which is what keeps answers grounded rather
than hallucinated. Questions are forced to be self-contained (name the entity, not
"this document") so the data trains a **closed-book** assistant that matches how
the model is actually served.

Realized dataset:

| | |
|---|---|
| Generated → judged → deduped | 7,495 → 5,856 → **5,846** final pairs |
| Train / val | 5,554 / 292 |
| Source mix | case-law 45% · SEC 45% · web 10% |
| Task mix | qa 42% · extraction 21% · summarization 20% · rewrite 17% |
| Difficulty | easy 26% · medium 44% · hard 30% |
| Teacher / judge | `gemini-flash-lite` / `gemini-flash` |

### The SFT training
File: `train_sft.py`. **Single GPU, full fine-tune, no DDP / `torch.compile`** — the
workload is tiny, and multi-GPU would only re-introduce the fragility from Phase 5
for zero speedup.

| | |
|---|---|
| Base | `thesreedath/slm-125m-base` |
| Method | **full fine-tune** (not LoRA) |
| Hardware | **1 × L4** |
| Epochs | 2 |
| LR | 3e-5, cosine decay, 3% warmup |
| Precision | bf16 compute, fp32 master weights |
| Loss | on **answer tokens only** (prompt masked to `-100`) |
| Tokens seen | ~1.0M |
| Time | ~80 seconds |
| Val loss | 4.27 → **2.06** |

**Chat format** — the tokenizer has role tokens but no chat template, so we define one:
```
<|bos|><|system|>{system}<|user|>{question}<|assistant|>{answer}<|eos|>
```
Only the `{answer}…<|eos|>` span contributes to the loss, so the model learns to
*produce* answers rather than echo prompts.

**Result:** the model now responds in-format instead of rambling. Asked *"In a
breach of contract claim, what must the plaintiff prove?"* it returns a numbered
list of elements. Factual precision is bounded by 125M capacity — it learns the
*shape* of a grounded answer and will still invent specifics.

### Fine-tuning design decisions
- **Full fine-tune, not LoRA.** LoRA exists to save memory on billion-parameter
  models; at 125M, full FT is cheap (~$0.05) and higher quality.
- **Single GPU, no DDP.** ~1M tokens over 2 epochs is seconds of compute; multi-GPU
  adds coordination overhead and the `torch.compile`+NCCL failure modes for nothing.
- **2 epochs.** Validation loss bottomed near epoch 1 (2.045) and *rose* by epoch 3
  (2.11) while train loss kept falling — classic mild overfitting. 2 epochs
  (val 2.06) is the sweet spot.
- **LLM-as-judge.** A teacher can hallucinate; a second strong model that keeps only
  grounded, correct, self-contained pairs removes ~22% of raw output. Quality over
  quantity — cf. LIMA: 1,000 excellent pairs beat 100,000 noisy ones.
- **~5,000 pairs.** Enough to imprint Q&A behavior on a small model without
  overfitting; a giant noisy set would just be memorized.

### Using the fine-tuned model
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-sft")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-sft", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

system = "You are a knowledgeable legal and financial assistant. Answer accurately and concisely."
question = "What is the purpose of a Form 10-K filing?"

def sid(t): return tok.convert_tokens_to_ids(t)
ids = (tok("<|bos|>", add_special_tokens=False)["input_ids"]
       + [sid("<|system|>")] + tok(system, add_special_tokens=False)["input_ids"]
       + [sid("<|user|>")]   + tok(question, add_special_tokens=False)["input_ids"]
       + [sid("<|assistant|>")])
out = model.generate(torch.tensor([ids]), max_new_tokens=120, do_sample=True,
                     temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, eos_token_id=sid("<|eos|>"),
                     pad_token_id=sid("<|pad|>"))
print(tok.decode(out[0][len(ids):], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## RAFT: grounding the model in retrieved context

The SFT model answers from memory, but a 125M model's memory is tiny and it fabricates.
**RAFT** ([Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10131)) teaches it
to answer from *context you provide*, and to ignore irrelevant distractor documents.

- 🤗 **RAFT model:** https://huggingface.co/jonam-ai/legal-slm-125m-raft

### The idea
Each RAFT example is `question + [oracle doc + distractor docs] → grounded answer`. Two
tricks: mix the oracle with distractors so the model learns to find the signal, and for a
fraction of examples remove the oracle so it does not blindly trust retrieval. The answer
quotes the source span (`##begin_quote## … ##end_quote##`), then states the final answer.
Adapted for a **1,024-token** model: short ~200-token chunks, 2 distractors, 81%
oracle-present / 19% distractor-only.

### The dataset (`raft.py`)
Same teacher-distillation shape as SFT, but with **OpenRouter `minimax/minimax-m3`** as
teacher + judge (a rate-limit story of its own — see gotchas):
```bash
modal run raft.py::build        # generate + LLM-judge (OpenRouter minimax-m3)
modal run raft.py::curate_run   # dedup + assemble oracle+distractors + tokenize
```
4,069 examples (3,866 train / 203 val); teacher + judge cost ~$7.

### The fine-tune (`train_raft.py`)
Continues from the SFT model, 1×L4, 2 epochs, loss on the answer only. Val loss
**2.13 → 0.54** (grounded answering is easier than closed-book QA — the answer is in the
context). `modal run train_raft.py::run`

### Does it help? The base → SFT → RAFT arc
Measured with `raft_eval.py` on the **same** held-out RAFT validation set (context +
distractors → answer), for all three models:

| Model | Perplexity ↓ | Answer-match accuracy ↑ |
|---|---|---|
| base (mentor, 10-epoch) | 15.85 | 0.5% |
| SFT | 8.31 | 7.4% |
| **RAFT** | **1.74** | **17.2%** |

Perplexity on the grounded answer drops **9×** across the arc; answer-match accuracy
(strict exact-answer containment on greedy generations) climbs **35×**. The absolute 17.2%
is modest — a 125M model under a harsh exact-match metric — but the monotonic jump is the
point: **each stage makes the model measurably better at grounded answering.**

### Serving (`inference_raft.py`)
A scale-to-zero Modal endpoint takes `{context, question}` and streams the grounded answer.
It powers the **RAFT** section of the live demo: paste context (with noise), ask, and watch
it quote the relevant span and ignore the distractors.

## Cost, honestly

This project is *not* free — the GPU pretraining is the real expense, and being
honest about it helps you budget:

| Resource | Cost | What |
|---|---|---|
| H100 (Modal) | ~$36 | Phase 5: 2-epoch pretraining (plus some avoidable debugging waste) |
| CPU (Modal) | ~$2 | Phases 0–4 data pipeline |
| L4 (Modal) | ~$0.07 | Phase 6 evaluation |
| Deployed inference (Modal) | ~$0.06 | Phase 7 endpoint (scale-to-zero) |
| Gemini API | ~$2.0 | Phase 8: Q&A synthesis (~$0.45) + LLM-judge (~$1.54) |
| L4 (Modal) | ~$0.05 | Phase 8: 2-epoch fine-tune |
| OpenRouter (minimax-m3) | ~$7.2 | Phase 9: RAFT dataset synthesis + judge |
| L4 (Modal) | ~$0.3 | Phase 9: RAFT fine-tune + arc eval |
| **Total usage** | **~$48** | Modal (~$39) + Gemini (~$2) + OpenRouter (~$7) |

Modal's free tier (~$30/month credits) absorbs most of the Modal spend; out-of-pocket
for the Modal side was ~$9, and the fine-tuning stage (Phases 8) added only ~$2 of
Gemini + $0.05 of GPU. **The single biggest lever is the pretraining GPU spend** —
fewer epochs or a single-H100 run cost proportionally less. Everything except Phase
5 is cents.

## Gotchas we already paid for

1. **The mix is legal-first, not 70/20/10.** The legal sources only hold ~2B tokens.
2. **Modal image rule:** all `pip_install` / `apt_install` must come *before*
   `add_local_python_source`, or the image build errors.
3. **`is_english` is ASCII-first**, calling `langdetect` only on the ambiguous
   90–99% ASCII band — keep that ordering, `langdetect` is slow per document.
4. **The OCR gate needs the system wordlist** (`/usr/share/dict/words`), provided
   by the `wamerican` apt package in the base image.
5. **`torch.compile` + DDP is fragile.** A manual `all_reduce` for loss logging
   deadlocked NCCL against the compiled graph — log rank-0's local loss instead.
   And evaluate on the **raw** (un-DDP, uncompiled) module without toggling
   `.eval()/.train()`, or you force a recompile mid-run and desync the ranks.
6. **`modal deploy` won't swap a warm container's code.** Stop the app
   (`modal app stop --yes`) then redeploy; verify with a version marker.
7. **Avoid `from __future__ import annotations` in the FastAPI file** — it turns
   route type hints into strings FastAPI can't resolve for locally-imported classes.
8. **Keep heavy steps fanned out one-worker-per-shard.** Modal can preempt a long
   single container; sharded work is preemption-safe.
9. **Respect the LLM API's *token*-per-minute limit, not just requests.** The RAFT
   build hammered a 200k-TPM OpenAI key with 192-way concurrency → a storm of 429s
   and a timeout. The fix was not "more retries" but *less concurrency* on a
   higher-throughput model (OpenRouter minimax-m3). Fighting a rate limit is a waste;
   change the limit.
10. **`minimax-m3` emits literal newlines inside its JSON strings.** Parse teacher
    output with `json.loads(text, strict=False)` or you will silently drop good rows.
